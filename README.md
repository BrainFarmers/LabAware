A Lab to Play God with Sentient Automatons

## Description
LabAware is a tool to help experiment between automatons and neural networks in a way of making lifetime systems to play and research on mimicking "sentient" behavior.

This product results from the shock of two observations :
- `We have no start on understanding sentient mechanism` making a framework to play and experiment with a needed step
- `Gamification is the way to go` if we want to achieve better artificial intelligence. Games are our trial&error mechanism and it engages both the user and the system in performance improvement and better synergy

This is an attempt of making a user friendly development environment for getting better at making products derived from machine learning. This approach aim to implement logical programming, mainly used in automatons development, by assimilating everything to a fuzzy Mealy machine.
Then it can be parameterized and instantiated by the user. 

LabAware is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License v2.0](LICENSE). So the **LabAware framework can be used in projects that are not open source**.
However, changes to LabAware itself need to be published under the same license.

The project is currently under development and no workable release is yet to be announced.
