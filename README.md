## Description
LabAware is a tool to help experiment between automatons and neural networks in a way of making lifetime systems to play and research on mimicking "sentient" behavior.

LabAware is licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0. So the **LabAware framework can be used in projects that are not open source**.
However, changes to LabAware itself need to published under the same license.

The project is currently under development and no workable release is yet to be announced.
